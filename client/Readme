## Installation
This application has all the packages already installed. Once you have navigated to your command line and are in the correct folder for Pawfect Match, you simply run the command npm run dev. From there the app should kick off and our home page will load. There you will be greeted by a few smiling faces of adorable animals. 

## Usage
Once you have the application open, you are directed to our home page with our amazing logo that Marcus Matthews created. If you scroll down just at little you will see 3 adorable animals. Once you hover over those a small bio, age and Name of the animal will display. You are then directed to select from our form a dog or cat, then choose the age range: under 5 yrs old or over 5, from there you can choose a male or female animal. Once you click search you will be directed to another page with a match of the animals available. You can either sign in before or after this step. Once signed it you can save the animals you are interested in while you continue to look through our directory. Once you have made your decision you can adopt your new best friend!!
